# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! 

Here, I have compiled a selection of projects that showcase my skills and expertise as a data analyst. This repository contains projects utilizing SQL, Excel, and Python, demonstrating a range of data analysis and visualization techniques.

Note that the link to the Tableau visualization for the part 2 of the Tourist Rentals project is given in the SQL project description.
