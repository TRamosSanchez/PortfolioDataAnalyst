# SQL Project: Tourist Rentals in Spain (Part 1)

This project aims to identify the most attractive regions in Spain for short-term tourist rentals from the point of view of an investor. Attractiveness is defined using two key indicators: occupancy rate and number of available rental properties. These metrics are analyzed both in aggregate and in terms of their recent trends.

In this first part of the project, the focus is on cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for visualization in Tableau. The raw data comes from the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica (INE) website and is available as CSV files in this directory.

The second part of the project consists of creating a dashboard in Tableau to visualize the results and draw actionable insights about regional tourist activity. Link to the dashboard : https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tomas.ramos.sanchez/viz/TouristRentalsinSpain/Dashboard1
