# Excel Project: Staffing tool

This project features an Excel file designed as a staffing tool to enable managers to allocate personnel time across various projects. The unit of measurement used throughout is Person-Month (PM) as this is a common measurement used by management. 

To achieve a balance between clear visualization and ease of editing, while maintaining the practicality of a database table, I developed a custom editable kind of pivot table system that works with macros to load and save data to the database table. 
The file incorporates several safeguards to minimize human errors, including within the macros and through color-coding. For example, the tool can handle changes in work regimes, even if they occur mid-year, thereby accurately displaying the maximum number of PMs a person has available annually. 

The tool's easy-editing capability is crucial for adapting to unforeseen changes, such as a project extension, an employee leaving the company, switching to a part-time contract, â€¦  allowing managers to quickly assess impacts and reallocate resources as needed.

Note that you will need Excel 365 to read this file properly as it uses the latest features.

You will find the global project overview and a user's guide inside "Staffing tool - Readme.docx".
